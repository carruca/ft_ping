nslookup for find the ip address of a domain name (DNS Resolver)


errors:
	- TTL (time to live) Expired in Transit
	- Destination Host Unreachable
	- Request Timed Out
	- Unknown Host

steps:
	- input: -option hostname
	- dns lookup: gethostbyname()
	- after CTRL + C, a report : Interrupt Handler sets loop condition false
	- loop:
		* set ttl option
		* set timeout recv funtion
		* send packet:
			+ ICMP_ECHO Header struct
			+ Pid process
			+ msg part randomly
			+ checksum
		* wait for recv packet

option flags:
	- f: flood ping (root only) - no wait for replies
	- l, --preload=NUMBER: send NUMBER packets as fast as possible
												before falling into normal mode of behavior
												(root only)
	- n, --numeric: do not resolve host addresses
	-w, --timeout=N: stop after N seconds
	-W, --linger=N: number of seconds to wait for response
	-p, --pattern=PATTERN: fill ICMP packet with given pattern (hex)
	-r, --ignore-routing: send directly to a host
											on an attached network
	-s, --size=NUMBER: send NUMBER data octets
	-T, --tos=NUM: set type of service (TOS) to NUM
	-q: quiet output
	-ttl=N: specify N as time-to-live
	--ip-timestamp=FLAG: IP timestamp of type FLAG,
											which is one of "tsonly" and "tsaddr"
